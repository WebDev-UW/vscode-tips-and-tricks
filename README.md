"There are more extensions avaliable for VS Code than there are stars in the sky." -Bill Gates

Extensions are the bread and butter of VS Code. You can use them to customize VS Code's look & feel, add support for new languages, format your code automagically, and collaborate with your friends in realtime.

Take a look! Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar and search for whatever floats your boat. There's probably an extension avaliable for anything you can imagine; [if there isn't, make one!](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)
