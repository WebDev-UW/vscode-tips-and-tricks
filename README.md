# VS Code Tips and Tricks

## Welcome

Visual Studio Code is a free, (mostly) open-source text editor from Microsoft. It offers a fully-customizable coding workspace with syntax highlighting, code autocomplete, built-in Git, and advanced debugging tools.

## Installing

## Getting Started

You'll probably recognize VS Code's user interface from other code editors. There's a sidebar on the left, a status bar at the bottom, and the primary editing space in the center right.

**Use `Ctrl` + `Shift/Command` + `P` to access all avaliable commands.**

### Explorer

The Explorer tab is used to browse, open, and manage all of the files and folders in your project. You'll probably use the Explorer every time you use VS Code.

### Source Control

The Source Control tab is used to view changes, write commit messages, and push/pull your code.

### Search

The Search tab is used to find text across your entire project. You can use it to find classes, strings, or anything else hiding deep in your project.

Sidenote: use the Find command to find text in a specific file.

## Extensions

"There are more extensions avaliable for VS Code than there are stars in the sky." -Bill Gates

Extensions are the bread and butter of VS Code. You can use them to customize VS Code's look & feel, add support for new languages, format your code automagically, and collaborate with your friends in realtime.

Take a look! Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar and search for whatever floats your boat. There's probably an extension avaliable for anything you can imagine; [if there isn't, make one!](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)

### Themes

You can update your theme using the `Preferences: Color Theme` command.
